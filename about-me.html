            <p>To my friends, I’m the kind guy. To my customers and coworkers,
            I’m the teacher. To my enemies...I’m still awkwardly kind. It’s a hard 
            habit to break, but one that helps me fit in well with a multitude of 
            teams and environments. I will always be the guy who is willing to talk 
            about almost any topic that might come time someone’s mind, willing to 
            find every chance to read a book and bursting out in song at the drop 
            of a hat. At the same time, I will always be the person who will go 
            above and beyond to make sure things get done right and committed to 
            making sure that everyone feels like they have a part.</p>

            <p>After 5 years of medical research working in labs that filled up a 
                whole floor to a shoebox in the basement, all with low to no human 
                interaction, I decided I needed a change. I wanted to find something 
                that would still allow me to make a difference, but would allow me 
                to have a high amount of collaboration with others to create more 
                tangible results. This lead to me working for 2 ½ years as an 
                Immigration Program Manager overseeing $10+ million in business 
                revenue as we helped people have legal work authorization and gave 
                companies across the country access to that talent. While this role 
                change gave me the collaboration I craved along with quicker results, 
                it was still missing something. In the end, I lost the ability to 
                create, which was one of the things that I loved about research.</p>

            <p>With my immigration work, I ended up interacting a lot with people who
                 worked on all sides of the software development spectrum. These 
                 conversations and their passion for the work that they were about to 
                 build and create turned on a lightbulb for me.</p>

            <p>Web development is like the perfect blend of languages and math. I bundle 
                things together just right and something beautiful comes out. At the same 
                time, If I throw things together just to see what happens, you continue 
                to discover something new. All of this happens while I ultimately create 
                something that I can share immediately. At the same time, it requires high 
                amounts of collaboration as you work with others to put everything together.</p>

            <p>It sounded perfect, so I joined a full-stack Bootcamp where I’ve grown my 
                appreciation for languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Now I strive to continue learning more and refining my skills. I’m 
                excited to see how I can continue to create something beautiful and 
                useful for everyone around me.</p>
