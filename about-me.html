                <p class="headline-text">I’m a full-stack engineer with enough experience in customer success to be dangerous. 
                I love collaborating with diverse teams and individuals as we work to create something 
                cool and unique.</p>

            <p class="text-box myself">To my friends, I’m the kind guy. To my customers and coworkers,
            I’m the teacher. To my enemies...I’m still awkwardly kind. It’s a hard 
            habit to break, but one that helps me fit in well with a multitude of 
            teams and environments. I will always be the guy who is willing to talk 
            about almost any topic that might come time someone’s mind, willing to 
            find every chance to read a book and bursting out in song at the drop 
            of a hat. At the same time, I will always be the person who will go 
            above and beyond to make sure things get done right and committed to 
            making sure that everyone feels like they have a part.</p>

            <p class="text-box workhis">After 5 years of medical and physics research 
                in labs of all sizes, all with little to no human 
                interaction, I decided I needed a change. I wanted to find something 
                that would still allow me to make a difference, but would allow me 
                to have a high amount of collaboration with others to create more 
                tangible results. This lead to me working for 2 ½ years as an 
                Immigration Program Manager overseeing $10+ million in business 
                revenue as we helped people have legal work authorization and gave 
                companies across the country access to that talent. While this role 
                change gave me the collaboration I craved along with quicker results, 
                it was still missing something. In the end, I lost the ability to 
                create, which was one of the things that I loved about research.</p>

            <p class="text-box influence">With my work, I ended up interacting 
                with people who worked on all sides of the software development 
                spectrum. Their passion for the work that they had and were about to 
                 build turned on a lightbulb for me.</p>

        <div class="flex-center">
            <p class="text-box current">Web development is like the perfect blend of languages and math. I bundle 
                things together just right and something beautiful comes out. At the same 
                time, If I throw things together just to see what happens, you continue 
                to discover something new. All of this happens while I ultimately create 
                something that I can share immediately. At the same time, it requires high 
                amounts of collaboration as you work with others to put everything together.</p>

            <p class="text-box future">It sounded perfect, so I joined a full-stack Bootcamp where I’ve grown my 
                appreciation for languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now I strive to continue learning more and refining my skills. I’m 
                excited to see how I can continue to create something beautiful and 
                useful for everyone around me.</p>
